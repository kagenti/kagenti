This is the Agent Catalog page. Here you can see all deployed AI agents organized by namespace. Each agent shows its status, protocol type, and framework. You can import new agents using the Import button, which supports both pre-built container images and building from source code using Shipwright. Clicking on an agent opens its detail page where you can interact with it through the chat interface using the A2A protocol.
