[intro]
In this demo, we explore the Kay-jentee agent chat interface, showing real-time agent interactions using Google's A-to-A protocol.

[login]
We authenticate through Keycloak to access the platform. The same identity is used when the agent communicates with its backend services.

[agent_catalog]
In the Agent Catalog, we navigate to the team1 namespace to find our weather service agent. The catalog shows each agent's status, protocol, and framework information.

[agent_detail]
The weather service agent detail page shows deployment status, the A-to-A agent card with capabilities, and available skills. This agent uses the A-to-A protocol for structured agent communication.

[chat_open]
We switch to the Chat tab to interact with the agent. The chat interface supports the full A-to-A protocol, including streaming responses, task management, and event tracking.

[chat_query]
We type a query asking about the weather in San Francisco. The agent will process this through its LLM backend and invoke its weather tool via M-C-P to retrieve real data.

[chat_streaming]
The agent streams its response in real time using the A-to-A protocol. We can see the Markdown-formatted response as it arrives, including temperature, conditions, and other weather details. Every interaction generates OpenTelemetry traces for observability.

[chat_events]
The Events panel reveals the underlying A-to-A protocol interactions. We can see task creation, status updates, and artifact generation events. This transparency helps developers debug agent behavior.

[chat_followup]
We send a follow-up query comparing weather between cities. The agent maintains session context across messages, enabling natural multi-turn conversations.

[chat_followup_response]
The agent processes the follow-up query using the same session, demonstrating contextual awareness. It compares temperatures and conditions across locations, showcasing the agent's conversational capabilities.

[end]
This completes the agent chat demonstration. The A-to-A protocol provides structured, observable agent interactions with streaming responses, event transparency, and multi-turn conversation support.
