[intro]
Importing an agent to Kay-jentee.

[login]
We authenticate through Keycloak. The identity determines namespace access and resource permissions.

[import_navigate]
From the catalog, we click Import Agent to open the form.

[import_examples]
Examples provide pre-configured templates.

[import_name]
We set the agent name and target namespace.

[import_source]
The source section defines the git repository URL, subdirectory path, and branch to build from.

[import_framework]
The framework selector sets the runtime.

[import_protocol]
Protocol determines communication style.

[import_deploy_method]
Deployment method toggles between building from source and deploying a pre-built container image.

[import_workload]
Workload type controls the Kubernetes resource kind — Deployment for stateless, StatefulSet for persistent storage.

[end]
That covers the Import Agent form. Kay-jentee supports the full spectrum of agent deployment configurations.
