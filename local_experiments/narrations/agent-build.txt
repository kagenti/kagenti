[intro]
Building an agent in Kay-jentee.

[login]
We authenticate through Keycloak. Build operations require namespace permissions.

[build_import]
We fill in the Import Agent form with the agent name, namespace, source path, and build strategy. The strategy determines which build tool compiles the code.

[build_submit]
Submitting the form triggers a Shipwright Build Run that compiles the agent into a container image.

[build_progress]
The build page shows the current phase — Pending, Running, Succeeded, or Failed — updating in real time.

[build_metadata]
Build metadata shows the source repository, target image, and build strategy.

[build_events]
The events panel surfaces Kubernetes events — pod scheduling, layer caching, and push progress.

[build_status]
We monitor until the build succeeds. A successful build pushes the image and starts deployment.

[end]
That covers the agent build lifecycle. Kay-jentee uses Shipwright for Kubernetes-native source-to-image builds.
