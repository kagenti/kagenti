Welcome to the Kagenti platform demo. Kagenti is a cloud-native middleware for deploying and orchestrating AI agents. It provides framework-neutral infrastructure with built-in authentication via Keycloak, service mesh security through Istio, and full observability with Phoenix tracing. In this recording, you can see the web dashboard where teams manage their agents and tools across namespaces, import new agents from source or container images, and monitor their status in real time.
